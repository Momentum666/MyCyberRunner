## Performance & Architecture
Movement Efficiency
Frame-consistent physics: Player movement and jump behavior are handled using FixedUpdate with Rigidbody2D to ensure smooth and physics-consistent control.

Lightweight flip logic: Character flipping is implemented using simple rotation rather than scale inversion to avoid animation glitches or performance spikes.

## Animation System
State-driven animations: Animations dynamically respond to velocity and grounded status using Unityâ€™s Animator parameters.

Optimized transitions: Reused animation transitions and minimized state complexity reduce overhead and keep the animation system clean.

## Performance & Power Awareness
While currently built for desktop, the system architecture is optimized to avoid unnecessary updates and is prepared for future energy-aware enhancements:

Dash cooldown limiter: Dashing is limited by a cooldown timer to prevent rapid physics calls.

Preprocessed ground detection: isGrounded is calculated early to avoid redundant checks during the update cycle.

Conditional input handling: Jump and dash logic is only triggered on relevant input, minimizing idle frame operations.

## Code Structure & Extensibility
Modular logic: Movement, jump, dash, animation, and direction control are all separated into clean, testable methods.

Inspector-friendly: Core gameplay parameters are exposed via SerializedField to allow easy tuning in Unity Editor.

Debug utilities: Debug.Log() and Gizmos are used to visualize state and collisions during development.

## Future Architecture Readiness
This game structure is intentionally designed to support further systems:

âœ… State machine system for enemies and bosses

âœ… Input abstraction layer for keyboard/gamepad compatibility

âœ… Cooldown manager for advanced skill systems

âœ… FX trigger system for sound and particle integration
